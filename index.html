        <!--below talks briefly about my chosen color -->
        <p>There are three primary colors on the color spectrum.  They are
        red, yellow and blue.  You can make any other color imaginable by mixing
        various combinations of these colors.
        </p>

        <p>For my project, I'm talking about the color blue.  Which also happens
        to be my favorite color.
     </p>
        <p>Some of the reasons I like this color is because of the range
        of shades.  It can range from the lightest almost white 
        shades of blue.</p> 
        
               <!--this is how you save a pic -->

        <p> Notice the various and subtle shades of blue in the picture from the light 
        piercing the clouds to all the shades around it.
       </p>
        
        <p>And, it can go in the opposite direction 
        to the darkest nearly black shades of 
        of blue.</p>

    <div>
          <p>Again, notice how the blue shades range from light to almost black.</p>
